# Human-Brain-Gene-Regulatory-Network-Analysis-GSE5281
This project focuses on constructing a gene regulatory network (GRN) from real human brain gene expression data to identify key regulatory interactions and hub genes. Using the publicly available GEO dataset GSE5281, which contains expression profiles of 100 human brain samples.
